Emphasized design principles to ensuring modular and maintainable code.
By separating implementations into dedicated files and leveraging base test classes for code reuse, we optimized readability and minimized redundancy.
Additionally, I applied principles of the Open-Closed Principle (OCP) to keep implementations closed for modification while allowing for extension through wrapper functions like position validation.
